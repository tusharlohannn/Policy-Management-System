In this project, I have implemented a policy manager system.
In order to interact with the webpage, you'll have to follow the given steps.

1. Type node index.js in the terminal while in the root directory.
2. This will run the server on the port number 3000.
3. Now open your browser and type http://localhost:3000/index.html in the searchbar.
4. This will take you to the login page.
5. If you want to login as a user, enter the username and password and select user in the dropdown and hit login. (Username: user1, Password: pass1) You can use these credentials for a user login.
6. After you are logged in, you'll be able to see the user.html page, which displays the list of policys the user is interested in.
7. You can edit, delete and add users to the database by interacting with the UI.
8. Now click on the Inventory button in the header, this will take you to the inventory with all the listed policies. You can request and policy from the list. The policy will be added to your list only if the admin accepts your request.
9. You can now logout of the user account by clicking the logout button in the header.

Admin Login:
1. While you're on the login page, you can login as an admin by entering the details and selecting admin from the dropdown. You can use these credentials for an admin login(Username- admin, Password- admin123).
2. After you are logged into the website, you'll be able to see the list of users available on this website. You can add, delete or update these users by interacting with the UI.
3. Now, click on the inventory button in the header, this will take you to the main inventory in the database. You can see the list of inventory, below which are the total no.of policys and the total no.of pending requests from users.
4. When you scroll down, you can see the list of policies requested by users. You can either accept these requests or reject these requests as per your need.
5. After you're done working, you can logout from the admin account by clicking the logout button in the header.
